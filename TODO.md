# TODO
* Creating notes doesn't work
* Save notes to proper place (~/.nete or so)
* Clean up, organize code
* Make Debian package
* Write tests (at least for the models)
* Update nete command line client
* first version

* Sort notes by something (name, last change)
* Search functionality (by title, by content)

* attach files

## Ideas
* Forward/Back buttons and shortcuts

## Optional
* Loading indicator for long-loading notes (because of slow markdown-rendering)
* Lazy saving (save every few seconds only) - though it works for now
* use a faster markdown renderer (this one is very slow for large texts)
